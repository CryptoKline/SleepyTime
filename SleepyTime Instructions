Right click windows Start button and run terminal as admin

Enter the following into the terminal and press enter (this allows your computer to run unsigned powershell scripts)

Save SleepyTime.ps1 to your computer
For convenience, I have SleepyTime.ps1 saved in c:\windows\system32

In windows search bar, type "powershell" and hit enter. Then right click powershell and run as administrator (Must be ran with admin privileges)

Powershell by default opens to the system32 folder (hence the convenience thing earlier). Type "SleepyTime.ps1" (without quotations) and hit enter if you have saved it to system32. If not, type in powershell "cd c:\your location here\SleepyTime.ps1" (without quotations) and hit enter. 

The script should run and prompt you for the date.
Enter the date in the format MM:DD or M:D then hit enter

The script should prompt you for the time
Enter the time in the format HH:MM am/pm or H:M am/pm then hit enter

Close powershell if it's still open after entering the time. 

This will automatically create a basic task in the task scheduler to put your machine to sleep on whatever date, at whatever time you input during the prompt.
It's a one time use task so next time you want to set a sleep time, just run the script again and input the new date and time. 

NOTE: The script does not automatically delete the task that was created so if you use this often, you may want to clear out your task scheduler of all the sleep tasks that you have previously used. 
They are disabled after one time use but they will clutter up your scheduler. If any experts out there know how the script could auto delete the task, feel free to modify the script. 
To clear the task scheduler, type in windows search bar "task scheduler" (without quotations) and open the scheduler. In the task scheduler libray, look for any old entries named "PutComputerToSleep_########_######" and delete them.
