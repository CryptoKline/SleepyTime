# SleepyTime
Set a sleep Date and Time instead of windows sleep timer

This is a powershell script I created due to some issues I've had with programs not allowing the computer to go to sleep. My personal experience is stability testing software like TestMem5 will put your computer to sleep in the middle of the memory test if there's user activity or something like OCCT that won't allow sleep to function if the program is open at all. Those are just two examples. This script works by prompting the user for the Date and Time the computer should be put to sleep. This solves both of the above mentioned software sleep issues. It also solves the issue of windows only having a max 5hr sleep function. With TM5, I can guess about how long a test will take just from my own previous observations and I can set a sleep timer close to the duration of the test. But what if I accidentally move the mouse during the test? Then the sleep timer starts all over. Or what if I want to crank up the test duration and a 5hr sleep timer isn't long enough? If I want to run a OCCT 12 hour stability test, I always do it overnight. Then I'm at work the next day when the test finishes and my power hungry, overclocked pc is running all day until I get home. I'm not sure why windows doesn't have sleep time option instead of the sleep timer option but this is a little workaround for anyone else in the same boat.
